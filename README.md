# Circle Packing

This library provides a tool for circle packing in python, using the front-chain packing algorithm by [Wang *et al.*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1124772.1124851) and enclosed by a circle computed using the [Matou≈°ek-Sharir-Welzl algorithm](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/emo/PublFiles/SubexLinProg_ALG16_96.pdf).
